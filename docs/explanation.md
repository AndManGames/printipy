Why, oh why, does this exist: PrintiPy

- My good friend [@funkhouserw](https://github.com/funkhouserw) created a plethora of incredible greeting cards. Using the Printify platform, we wanted to bring these magnificent creations [to the world](https://www.etsy.com/shop/MacabreGreetings)! 
- The two of us have worked on several projects together, mostly in Python
- Unfortunately, there are Printify libraries available - like the [Node JS version](https://github.com/nasa8x/printify-api) - but not in Python
- We were able to hack together some basic automations using Python's `request` library, but soon found it necessary to include schema and data validation.
- Thus, the insane idea of creating and releasing our own library came to light!
- Plus! Printify, PrintiyPy... starting from the name, this library practically wrote itself!
